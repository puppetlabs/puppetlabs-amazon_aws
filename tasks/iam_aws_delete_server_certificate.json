This topic also includes a list of AWS services that can use the server certificates that you manage with IAM.   If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing, deleting the certificate could have implications for your application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the certificate. For more information, go to DeleteLoadBalancerListeners in the Elastic Load Balancing API Reference. ",
