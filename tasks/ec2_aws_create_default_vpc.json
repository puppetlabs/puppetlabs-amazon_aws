You cannot specify the components of the default VPC yourself. If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC. You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region. If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot use this action to create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see 'I really want a default VPC for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?' in the Default VPCs FAQ.",
