	"description": "Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The response includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the current AWS account.   ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with the labels reversed. For example:  com.example.www.  Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances. If the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode, ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded value, which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database. For example, to create a hosted zone for exämple.com, you specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes it as:  com.ex\344mple.  The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more information about valid domain name formats, including internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to the next:   The DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in the response contain the values, if any, specified for the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters in the request that produced the current response.   The MaxItems element in the response contains the value, if any, that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced the current response.   If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true, there are more hosted zones associated with the current AWS account.  If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the last hosted zone that is associated with the current account. The NextDNSName element and NextHostedZoneId elements are omitted from the response.   The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements in the response contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next hosted zone that is associated with the current AWS account. If you want to list more hosted zones, make another call to ListHostedZonesByName, and specify the value of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters, respectively.
