	"description": "Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. You can't start or stop Spot Instances, and you can't stop instance store-backed instances. When you stop an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM. Stopping an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, and terminating instances, see Instance Lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.",
