	"description": "This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using InitiateJob. Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory. You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the checksum on the client and verify that the values match to ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data. A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Amazon Glacier completes the job. That a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of bytes=0-1048575, you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon Glacier The expected size is also returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and verify that the size is what you expected. A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Amazon Glacier completes the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24 hours period after Amazon Glacier completes the job. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
